# Quantum Computing Tutorial
This repository contains code that seeks to serve as a "Hello World" to the realm of Quantum Computing and Physics. 

It makes use of the IBM QSKIT library in which one can access the computing power, randomness, and noise of a real quantum computer hosted by IBM. 

Some preliminary knowledge on quantum physics and circuits is required for a full understanding of the code, though it is well commented. 

Enjoy the short tutorial, I hope you find it insightful :)
